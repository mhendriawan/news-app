## Quick start
This is a normal flutter app. You should follow the instructions in the [official documentation](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install).
This project uses **BLoC** (business logic component) to separate the business logic with UI itself.
It's recommended to do self-study about it before jumping into the project [here](https://bloclibrary.dev/).

* [Equatable](https://pub.dev/packages/equatable) - Being able to compare objects in `Dart` often involves having to override the `==` operator.
* [Dio](https://github.com/flutterchina/dio/) - A type-safe HTTP client.
* [Shared Preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences) - Cache implementation approach.
* [Shimmer](https://pub.dev/packages/shimmer) - Loading handler.
